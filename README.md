# Coding Katas

## What are Coding Katas?
The term 'code kata' was coined by Dave Thomas and refers to an exercise in programming designed to hone programming
skills through the use of practice and repetition. Katas are usually small programming exercises that can be completed
in an hour or so, specifically designed to improve your skills in one or more small ways. They can focus on improving
muscle memory, getting used to a new language or development environment, practicing thinking about problems in a
logical way and breaking them down into constituent parts, trying things in a different way to see what happens,
using tests to drive out your design, and much more.
