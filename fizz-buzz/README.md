# FizzBuzz Kata

Fizz Buzz is a counting and number substitution game mainly aimed at teaching children division. Players take turns
counting up from one, replacing any number that is divisible by three with the word 'fizz', any number divisible by
five with the word 'buzz', and any number divisible by both three and five to be replaced with 'fizz buzz'.

For a given natural number greater than zero return:

- "fizz" if the number is dividable by 3
- "buzz" if the number is dividable by 5
- "fizzbuzz" if the number is dividable by 15
- the same number if no other requirement is fulfilled
